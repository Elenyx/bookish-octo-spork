# NexRPG Project

This project was migrated from Replit and contains the following main folders:

- `server/` — Backend server code
- `client/` — Frontend client code
- `shared/` — Shared code/resources between server and client

## Getting Started

2. **Run the server**
   - Navigate to the `server` folder and run the server start command (e.g., `npm start` or `node index.js`).

3. **Run the client**
   - Navigate to the `client` folder and run the client start command (e.g., `npm start` or `node index.js`).

4. **Development**
   - Edit code in the respective folders. Shared code should be imported as needed.
